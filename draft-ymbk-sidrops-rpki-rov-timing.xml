  <section anchor="Intro" title="Introduction">
    
    <t>
      As Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) based Route Origin
      Validation (ROV) becomes deployed in the Internet, the quality of
      the routing control plane, and hence timely and accurate delivery
      of packets in the data plane, depend more and more on prompt and
      accurate propagation of the RPKI data from the originating
      Certification Authorities (CAs), to Relying Parties (RPs), to
      routers.
    </t>
    
    <t>
      This draft is an exploration of and recommendations for timing
      of Resource Public Key Infrastructure publication, propagation,
      and use in relying parties and routers.
    </t>

    <t>
      There are the questions of how frequently a CA publishes, how
      often an RP pulls, and how often routers pull from their RP(s).
    </t>

    <t>
      For CAs publishing, a few seconds to a minuteseems easily achieved
      with reasonable software.  See <xref target="publish"/>.
    </t>

    <t>
      For RPs pulling, 600s may be optimistic in the short term given
      the load it will put on publication services and one notorious
      repository which is against spec but it should be achievable in
      a while.  An hour would be the longest acceptable window.  See
      <xref target="rp-pull"/>
    </t>

    <t>
      For the router(s) pulling from the RP(s), 300-3600 seconds is a
      wide window.  Remember, the rpki-rtr protocol does have the
      equivalent of dns notify, where the cache tells the router that
      it has some nice tasty new data.  See <xref
      target="router-pull"/>
    </t>

    <t>
      We discuss each of these in detail below.

    <t>It is assumed that the reader understands BGP, <xref
    target="RFC4271"/>, the RPKI, <xref target="RFC6480"/>, Route Origin
    Authorizations (ROAs), <xref target="RFC6482"/>, RPKI-based
    Prefix Validation, <xref target="RFC6811"/>, and Origin Validation
    Clarifications, <xref target="RFC8481"/>.</t>

  <section anchor="Struct" title="Deployment Structure">
    <t>
      Deployment of the RPKI to reach routers has a three-level
      structure as follows:
      <list style="hanging">
	
        <t hangText="Global RPKI:">
          The authoritative data of the RPKI are published in a
          distributed set of servers at the IANA, RIRs, NIRs, and ISPs
          (see <xref target="RFC6481"/>).
        </t>
	
        <t hangText="Relying Parties:">
          Relying Parties are a local set of one or more collected and
          verified caches of RPKI data.  A Relying Party, e.g., router
          or other client, MUST have a trust relationship with, and a
          trusted transport channel to, any RP(s) it uses.
        </t>
	
        <t hangText="Routers:">
          A router fetches data from a local cache using the protocol
          described <xref target="RFC8210"/>.  It is said to be a client
          of the cache.  There MAY be mechanisms for the router to
          assure itself of the authenticity of the cache and to
          authenticate itself to the cache.
